# Types

A type is a **SET** of values, and for programming languages they provide low level representations and include a collection of operations specific to them.

## Topics in Types
- Type annotations  (how to declare?)
- Type inference (how to determine?)
- Type checking (when to check?)
- Type equivalence issues (what is it?)

## Primitive Types VS Constructed Types

- **Primitive Types** cannot be constructed or defined, only used.
- **Constructed Types** can be defined and used within the context of a program.
